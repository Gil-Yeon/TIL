    "1. **ARIMA** MSE: This is the Mean Squared Error of the ARIMA model's predictions on the testing data. The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower MSE indicates better model performance. You can use this value to quantify how well the ARIMA model fits the testing data. For example, if the ARIMA MSE is low, it means the model's predictions are close to the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LSTM** MSE: Similarly, this is the Mean Squared Error of the LSTM model's predictions on the testing data. It measures the accuracy of the LSTM model's forecasts. You can compare this MSE to the ARIMA MSE to determine which model performs better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensemble** MSE: This is the Mean Squared Error of the ensemble of ARIMA and LSTM predictions on the testing data. An ensemble combines the predictions of multiple models to potentially improve accuracy. Comparing the ensemble MSE to the individual model MSEs helps assess whether the ensemble approach provides better results."
